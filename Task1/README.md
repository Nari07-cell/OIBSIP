# Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification 🌸

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into three species — **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica** — based on their sepal and petal measurements.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset:** Iris dataset (available in scikit-learn / UCI ML Repository).  
- **Features:** Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width.  
- **Target Classes:** Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica.  

---

## 🛠️ Approach
1. Import and explore the dataset.  
2. Perform **data visualization** (pair plots, histograms, scatter plots).  
3. Split dataset into train & test sets.  
4. Train models such as:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
5. Evaluate accuracy and compare models.

## 📊 Results
- Achieved accuracy: *(to be filled after training)*  
- Best performing model: *(to be filled after testing different models)*
